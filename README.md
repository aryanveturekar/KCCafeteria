# Online Food Delivery System 💻
 _Project for 5th Semester Subject_ -> **WDL & DBMS**


# KC Cafeteria 🍱

Here we provide the online canteen facility in the KCCEMSR campus. This facility is for the canteen in the KCCEMSR campus.

Usually People have to go to canteen and order the foods and they have to wait in queue for a long time to get the orders. But with the help of this you just have to follow a very simple process to order your stuffs. And you need not to wait in the long queue, you can enjoy your food at your own place. 

With this project we have eliminated the paper work and the long queue in the canteen completely. This system is quite easy to use and learn due to its attractive interface
