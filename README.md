# Online Food Delivery System
 Project for 5th Semester Subject -> WDL & DBMS

## KC Cafeteria 

Here we provide the online canteen facility in the KCCEMSR campus. This facility is for the canteen in the KCCEMSR campus.

Usually People have to go to canteen and order the foods and they have to wait in queue for a long time to get the orders. But with the help of this you just have to follow a very simple process to order your stuffs. And you need not to wait in the long queue, you can enjoy your food at your own place. 

As, you have logged-in with your webmail id, webmail password, you are redirected to an order page, order your food and fill up your account details.

Then, youâ€™ll be redirected to an address page where you have to fill in your mobile number and classroom, lab number.

Once you click the submit button you order will go to canteen and the canteen delivery man will bring the respective order in your classroom, Lab room in short period of time.
               
By this way you can save the time and you need not to pay extra charges for delivery of your orders.

With this project we have eliminated the paper work and the long queue in the canteen completely. This system is quite easy to use and learn due to its attractive interface
